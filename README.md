## Project Overview

Indian cuisine is incredibly diverse, rich in flavors, and deeply rooted in regional cultures. This project explores a curated dataset of Indian dishes and presents insights using an interactive Tableau dashboard.

The visualization helps answer questions such as:

* Which regions of India have the highest diversity of dishes?
* How does the distribution of **vegetarian vs non-vegetarian** dishes vary?
* Which **flavor profiles** (spicy, sweet, sour, bitter, etc.) are most common?
* What are the most popular dish **courses** (main course, snacks, dessert, etc.)?
* How do dishes spread across different **states** of India?

## Key Features & Insights

* **Regional dish distribution** with comparative analysis
* **Flavor profile breakdown** using pie/stacked charts
* **Diet type classification:** Vegetarian vs Non-Vegetarian
* **Course-wise insights:** Snacks, main course, desserts, beverages
* **State-level geographic visualization**
* Interactive filters for user-driven exploration
